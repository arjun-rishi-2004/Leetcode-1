 
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


My Solution:
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        first=[]
        second=[]
        for i in s :
            first.append(i)
        for j in t:
            second.append(j)
        first.sort()
        second.sort()
        if first==second:
            return True
        else:
            return False


MY SOLUTION WORKED FOR ALL THE TEST CASES IN  THE FIRST SUBMISSION !!!!

Problems with my solution:

Two arrays,Two sort functions, Two for loops-- not efficient one



Optimal Solution:
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return sorted(s)==sorted(t)

but sort takes O(nlog n) time complexity


Or use an Hashmap
